Assignment

Hello,
Thank you for this task.
regarding the first section of the task -
I'd rather use a Date object (than a xhr call that refreshes every second)
I would of use the Date object with UTC time and updating it with a function using getHours, getMinutes, getSeconds methods.

Apart from this issue, I hope you will enjoy my work.

Kind regards,
Einat
