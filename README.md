Assignment

Hello! Thank you for assiging me with thie task,

Regarding the first section -
I've used an XHR call to get the time but perhaps using a Date object (with UTC) and calling it with methods such as getHours, getMinutes, getSeconds would be more efficient.

I hope you will enjoy the results :-)

Kind regards,
Einat
